# Introduction to Scientific Visualization with Python

This is the repository for the PyCon Colombia 2019 tutorial on Scientific


 1. [Installation](#installation-instructions)


 # Installation Instructions

 We strongly encourage you to use ``conda`` to install the required packages for
 this tutorial. There are non-Python dependencies required that make manual
 installation or installing with ``pip`` very involved.

 Note also that this tutorial is written for Python 3.6. No guarantees of any
 kind are made that it will be compatible with Python 2.


Create a conda environment using the file ``environment.yml`` in the root
of the repository using

 ```console
 conda env create -f environment.yml
 ```

 This will create a conda environment named `scivistutorial` with all of the
 required packages.

 You can activate the environment with

 ```console
 source activate scivistutorial
 ```
 or on Windows:

 ```console
 activate scivistutorial
 ```
